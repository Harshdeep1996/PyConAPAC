# PyConAPAC

This is the repository which contains the slides and the code which I presented at PyCon APAC.

Clone the repository using: 

```
git clone https://github.com/Harshdeep1996/PyConAPAC.git
```

To access the slides, just open `pycon-slides.html`
To access the code, you would need to use `jupyter`

- to see the code in slides, do it using
  ```
  jupyter nbconvert pycon-code.ipynb --to slides --post serve
  ```
- to see the code in a notebook, for editing purposes maybe,
  ```
  jupyter notebook
  ```
  and open `pycon-code.ipynb`
